        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my modeling portfolio! My name is Adaora Onwumelu, and I am a versatile and passionate model specializing in high fashion, runway, and athletic shoots. My experience extends to commercial modeling, acting, and voiceovers, allowing me to bring creativity and professionalism to a variety of projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of modeling, I am a former 6th-year Division 1 basketball player, a journey that taught me discipline, resilience, and the importance of teamwork. Leveraging my athletic background, I bring energy and precision to athletic and performance-based shoots.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a proud advocate for women in technology, I combine my technical expertise with my creative pursuits. I am currently pursuing a career in tech and use my platform to inspire young women to break barriers in STEM fields. Alongside this, I am an active social media influencer, sharing my experiences in fashion, tech, and personal growth with my audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am always excited to collaborate on projects that align with my passion for storytelling and creativity. Whether it’s a high-energy runway show, a compelling voiceover performance, or an inspiring commercial, I am ready to bring your vision to life.
